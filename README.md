# SCM Library Management Mini Project

## Project Overview
This project is a simple library management system designed to demonstrate Software Configuration Management (SCM) principles.  
It includes:
- **Login Module (CI-06):** Secure login page with validation and "Remember Me" functionality.
- **Dashboard Module (CI-07):** Main service page displaying available books and feature buttons with full functionality.
- **Books Data (CI-08/CI-09):** JSON file and styles supporting the UI.
- **Test Documents (CI-10):** Planned for functional testing.

The project emphasizes SCM processes, version control, change requests, baselines, and releases rather than programming complexity.
